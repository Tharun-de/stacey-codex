                Stacey's Wraps began with a simple question: Why can't fast food be both healthy and environmentally responsible? 
                Our founder, Stacey, a nutritionist by training, was frustrated by the lack of truly 
                nutritious grab-and-go options that didn't come with excessive packaging waste.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                What started as weekend experiments in Stacey's kitchen eventually grew into a farmers market stand, 
                where the first versions of our now-popular Mediterranean Delight and Avocado Ranch Chicken wraps were born. 
                The enthusiastic response from market-goers confirmed what Stacey suspected: people were hungry for better options.

                  "I believed that we could create food that nourishes both people and the planet. Food shouldn't be a 
                  compromise between health, taste, convenience, and environmental impact."

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                As our concept evolved, we partnered with local organic farms to source the freshest ingredients 
                while reducing food miles. We invested in compostable packaging, developed water-saving kitchen practices, 
                and created a menu that caters to various dietary needs without sacrificing flavor.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Today, Stacey's Wraps stands as a testament to our belief that everyday food choices can make a difference. 
                We continue to innovate, both in our kitchen and in our sustainability practices, working toward a 
                future where healthy eating and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.
